# Perovskite-based-optoelectronic-systems-for-neuromorphic-computing
Brain-like neuromorphic computing system that mimics neuronal synapses using potassium ionâ€“doped perovskite units. It offers advanced optoelectronic signal processing and high-noise recognition by leveraging electric double layer formation and influence-based data relabeling for training bias resolution.
